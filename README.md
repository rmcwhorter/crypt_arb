So the idea behind this is basically that 
A) there are very many different exchanges for any given currency, making delta hedging quite easy
B) For the smaller currencies there will be huge variances in liquidity
C) Because crypto is treated as a sector, there will probably be very high correlations between some assets

ETHEREUM:
There are several exchanges for ethereum. They are:
Okex
Bit-Z
HitBTC
Bitnance
BitFinex
Huobi
Bithumb
Coinbase
Kraken
Bitstamp
CEX.IO
Gemini
Quoine
Liquid
bitFlyer
BitMEX
Poloniex
BitSquare
Bittrex
QuadrigaCX
Luno
BitBay

CryptoFacilities

We want to search for pricing errors in these indices. They will likely occur in the exchanges which are least liquid. So now we need to get quotes from these various exchanges.
